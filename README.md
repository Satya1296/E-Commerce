This project is a Full Stack E-Commerce Web Application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It provides a complete online shopping experience where users can browse products, place orders, make secure payments, and track their orders, while administrators manage products, users, inventory, and orders through an admin dashboard.
